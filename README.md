# Website Project: Travel Destination

This project was completed as part of the subject Information Technology 1 in upper secondary school.
The task was to create a website about a travel destination, and I chose South Korea.
**NOTE!** The following file directs to the home page: index.html

🎯 **Purpose**

To learn the basics of web development by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a project based on a self-chosen travel destination.


🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- HTML – for structuring the content of the website
- CSS – for styling and layout
- JavaScript – for adding simple interactivity

📄 **Website Contents**
- Homepage with an introduction to the destination
- Plan Your Trip (flights, hotels, public transport, car rental)
- Attractions and Activities (activity packages and suggestions)
- Culture (clothing, food, traditional music, history, art, festivals)
